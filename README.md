# Current Situation

The internet can be a miserable place. The combination of pseudonymity and social media functionality seems to encourage rampant hate speech, bullying, abuse, and generally harmful content. Content platforms have proven unwilling or unable to do enough about this situation, perhaps in part because they don’t have much incentive to address it. Additionally, there are many reasonable concerns that content removal by platforms often amounts to censorship and potentially contributes to radicalization.

# Vision

SpareME is a multi-platform mobile browser which incorporates a personalized content filter. The filter obscures individual blocks of text in a way that still allows them to be selectively revealed. SpareME learns over time the sort of things that the user doesn’t want to see and selectively hides only those sorts of things on pages they visit. This empowers individual users to more effectively avoid content they deem harmful, while not actually removing content from the platform or disrupting the user’s ability to access and engage with any part of the internet.
